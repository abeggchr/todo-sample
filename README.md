# ToDo-sample
This is a sample application template to show how different languages and build runners can be combinated to build an unified and streamlined buld/deploy-chain

## Technical
This template is based on the todomvc.com sample for angularjs. Therefore, the following technologies came in place for the application itself

* AngularJS
* ASP.NET WebAPI (SelfHosted)
 
## Build
The build consists of two chains
* NodeJs with npm gulp and bower (install gulp and bower in global)
* msbuild
* optional nuget for packageing
